Bugfix: Inform the admin if they enable an enterprise app without valid key

Previously no message was displayed but the app was not enabled.

Now, when the admin tries to enable an enterprise app when the enterprise key
is invalid, the message "cannot be enabled because of invalid enterprise key"
is displayed.
